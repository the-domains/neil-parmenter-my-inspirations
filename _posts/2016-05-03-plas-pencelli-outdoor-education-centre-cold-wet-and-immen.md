**Plas Pencelli. Outdoor Education Centre**.

Cold, wet and immense fun. Caving, kayaking, midnight walks and climbing and abseiling. Friendships forged for life and a foundation of a lifetime of adventure. The times here were priceless. ![](http://www.plaspencelli.co.uk/files/cache/2bb2b5e007f8652dfdcb1044e7ba27f2_f37.jpg)
