Parental Divorce. A tough time  
Coming out of the blue like it did was always going to change your life's direction but at an age to comprehend, it hit me less than my siblings. Never an easy period of life but looking back at how my mother coped with the three of us with little money and a strange new world ahead of her has only inspired me to never give up, no matter what presents itself in life. She was (and still is) the strongest woman i know and my respect and love for her knows no bounds. ![](http://thepropertybuyers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/divorce9.jpg)
