**Devizes Town FC Youth. THE manager.**

It was not the club itself that had such an influence on my life but the manager that trained me. From U9 to U16's, week in and week out, he was there, teaching us how to play as a team, handling our ever changing behaviour and, as our winning ways continued, keeping our ever larger ego's in check. On pitch fighting, off pitch fighting, troubles with parents, friends and others, wins, losses, highs and lows, he saw it all and somehow never quit.  
Certainly a driving force behind my desire to coach youth football and to instil the same ethics and standards as he did in me. ****
